# NDNSim TCP Comparison

Comparative study in congestion control between NDN and TCP new reno by generating a 6 node 2 bottleneck topology, inducing congestion and plotting link utilization graphs.

Installation : http://ndnsim.net/2.4/community-contributions.html

Running : Run ano-tcp.cc and new-ndn.cc for TCP new reno and ndnSIM respectively to obtain logs and throughput graphs using pcap as given in tcp-snap.pdf and ndn-snap.pdf respectively.
